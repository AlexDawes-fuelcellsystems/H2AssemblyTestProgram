H₂ Assembly Offline Test Rig – TwinCAT 3 Project

A dedicated TwinCAT 3 PLC + HMI project for pressure-testing and functionally verifying the hydrogen assembly offline, before installation on the main HyFlow/HyFleet machine.

This project is test-only, standalone, and not intended as a reusable production library. Its purpose is to provide a clean, structured environment for verifying hardware, valves, and pressure transducers against the P&ID.
